A half assed path tracer that also comes with half assed PBR for rasterization.

Known issues:
- Black spots (specular lighting seems kinda broken)
- Probably only works on nvidia gpus on windows (It does not work on my Intel machine running Linux). Currently no plans to fix this unless I port to Vulkan
